Our server just puts message to the dom without checking it. The dom is the tree based and we update it
by sending html element in message;

```
page += '<p>' + p + '</p>' + '\n' // vulnerable code
```

By the same logic we can abuse this bug in the any way and any put html element to your website.
for example: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yw6u6YkTgQ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
