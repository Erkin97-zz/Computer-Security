Our backend just puts text message to the dom without checking it. So the dom is the tree based we can 
just send html element in your request. 

By the same logic we abuse this bug in the any way and put html code to your website.
for example: <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw6u6YkTgQ4"/>

page += '<p>' + p + '</p>' + '\n' -> this is our bad code
