At first I thought that it's parsing your string
somehow to remove scripts, but it seems it just blocks additional even to be run.
So I tried to pass first simple html elements like "<b>bold</b>" and it was working.
We can still pass html element, but can't run script. In order to avoid I thought I can make button html element,
if u click it will alert, but you can do more easier. If you can pass iframe as an html element, then you can 
assign onload function to run, which will have different context. And it worked!
